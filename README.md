# github-sandbox test

> Finally some **permalinks** to test GitHub extensions

When to use this repo:

- When you want to create a test case for [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/refined-github/refined-github)

Rules:

- Do not touch pre-existing files, issues, PRs
- Once you create, close, delete a file… copy its link and then don't touch it again
- No specific rules about names, titles, etc… use and write what you need

## Usage example

1. I open an issue named `Testing in-title #1 issue references`
3. I use its URL in a PR, like:
  ```md
  I created this feature that works on titles. 
  
  # Test URLs
  
  https://github.com/refined-github/sandbox/issues/345
  ```
3. That's it! The issue you created will be here forever, hence the _permalink_ subtitle.

### Live example

I created several issues and PRs and used it in this demo page: https://github.com/fregante/github-issue-link-status/issues/57

Feel free to reuse the same links when testing, they're guaranteed to never change (they won't be closed, merged, etc)
